## Introduction
This repository provides implementations of three key computer vision techniques:

- **Background Subtraction**: A method used to separate foreground objects from the background in video sequences.
- **Mean Shift**: A non-parametric feature-space analysis technique used for clustering and object tracking.
- **Optical Flow**: A method used to estimate the motion of objects between consecutive frames in a video sequence.
